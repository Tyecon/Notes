## Mar-8-2025
Was feeling spiritually stressed so I did a bunch of star chart reading, tarot divining, middle pillar + lbrp exercises, prayer. On the way to work some trucker yelled "Bro, Jesus loves you bro" to me so I guess that's a good sign.  
I feel like I'm doing nothing but binging youtube while playing several mobile idle games which can't be healthy. Let's set some goals:
- [ ] Nextcloud setup for my office stuff
- [ ] Clean up notes, simplify and improve note taking
- [x] Improve self-care routine
- [ ] More ritual work
