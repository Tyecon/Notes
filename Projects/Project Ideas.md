## Learning MUD
In a video of an older software engineer he stated that one of the best ways to learn a programming language is to make a text adventure in it.
- Interacting with the console
- Managing static state (the world, monsters, items)
- Creative tools (editors)
- Managing dynamic states (player, inventory, exploration, interaction)
- Mathematic functions (combat, stats)
- Serialization (saving the game)
- Networking (Multi-User Dungeon Crawlers)
- Modularity, Testing, and Libraries.
- Like making a MMORPG but not stupidly scoped.
- Can add graphics later
