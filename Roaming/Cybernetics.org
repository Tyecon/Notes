Cybernetics is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the study of systems, control processes, and communication in both machines and living organisms. Coined by Norbert Wiener in the 1940s, the term "cybernetics" derives from the Greek word "kubernetes," meaning "steersman" or "governor." At its core, cybernetics focuses on understanding the principles of feedback, self-regulation, and information processing within systems.

Key concepts within cybernetics include feedback loops, which involve the transmission of information about a system's output back to its input, enabling adjustments and regulation. Cybernetic systems exhibit the ability to maintain stability and adapt to changes in their environment through feedback mechanisms.

Cybernetics has applications across disciplines, including engineering, biology, psychology, sociology, and management. It has influenced fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, systems theory, and organizational theory. By studying the dynamics of control and communication in complex systems, cybernetics provides insights into the behavior of systems ranging from simple mechanical devices to intricate social networks.
