"The first thought that goes through your mind is what you have been conditioned to think; what you think next defines who you are." This idea is basically the core of the dual process theory of cognition. The distinction between our unconscious and automatic gut reactions and deliberative/rational thought.
System 1 is fast, automatic, and often influenced by our past experiences and societal conditioning. Itâ€™s responsible for our immediate, gut reactions.
System 2 is slower and more deliberate. It requires conscious effort and is responsible for rational thinking and decision-making.
