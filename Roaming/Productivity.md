## Pomodoro
Work in short sprints (possibly add a timer), then rest for a short bit. After some time take a longer break. Try a more heuristic approach at first, and play around with different time ratios to see what works for you.
## Environment
Keep your work-spaces minimalist, clean, and free of distraction. Cleaning up your environment (or yourself) is one of the easiest ways to improve mental health, just wait for a day where you are hypomanic. No need for it to be perfect, just a bit at a time. Have certain areas that dedicated solely to work, fun/relaxation, and sleep and keep these areas limited to those tasks.
