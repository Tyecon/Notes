Get adequate sleep. Talk with your doctor if struggling. Practice a sleep hygiene routine before bed, limit blue light and stimulation, and keep your bed for just sleep.
## Lighting
Bright lights with a cool (blue) colour during work hours, warm dim lights before sleep (blue light filters on electronic devices).
## Phone
Your phone should require pressing the power button to wake. Social Media and Games should be on later pages. Notifications and badges should be heavily restricted. Set automatic Do Not Disturb (sometimes called bedtime mode) and Blue Light Filter settings.
