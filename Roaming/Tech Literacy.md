## Attention Economy
Your attention is worth something, spend it wisely. Remember that the main driver of the tech industry is advertising. Advertising contracting is a large portion of the public market, sports, streams, videos, blogs, and journalism. You can control your social media and advertising exposure through consciously manipulating your subscriptions, clicks, website choices, information resources, and device usage towards something that is healthier for you. Cut away the garbage that just isn't that good. Try technologies like RSS, Ad Blocking, Search Bangs, AI Chatbots, etc to reduce your exposure to biased and clueless journalism.
## Subscriptions: Software as a Service
So many products nowadays are trying to nickel and dime you constantly through subscriptions and fees. These services may seem cheap at first, but over time with several subscriptions the cost can add up. When you are paying a subscription for some software that means you don't own it, you are just renting it and can lose access at anytime the company wants. This includes things that are a one time payment, if their service goes down the things you paid for are lost.
## Digital Addiction: Doom-scrolling & Brain-rot
Doom-scrolling is the compulsive consumption of negative or anxiety-inducing news or social media content. This often leads to 'brain-rot'; detrimental cognitive and emotional effects of consuming such content. Prolonged doom-scrolling can foster anxiety, stress, and a skewed perception of reality, making it harder to focus or engage in meaningful activities. The cycle of endless scrolling feeds on the brain's craving for novelty, creating a feedback loop that makes it difficult to stop, even when it's causing harm. The famous book [[Aldous Huxley|Brave New World]] covers exactly why this is a problem.
There are several steps to deal with doom-scrolling. The first is to develop greater awareness and consciousness, such as mindfulness [[Meditation]] while browsing social media. Once you are aware of what kind of slop you are consuming, you can start to filter your app choices and subscriptions and ensuring only quality content gets through to you. This might require modifying or fully clearing your search and watch history to remove the things you just don't care for. Removing social media apps and using purely the browser is a good idea, so you can use plugins to control the content. Third, introducing new [[Hobbies]], [[Exercise]], [[Knowledge Management|note-taking]], [[Self-Help|self-care]] and better content will help keep you from relapsing. Using a spreadsheet, Zotero, or IMBD + myAnimeList + Goodreads to make a list of content you want to consume and stick to that instead of mindless scrolling. Replace visual content with audio along side physical activity. Install Firefox as a browser, add uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Decentraleyes, DeArrow (clickbait blocking), Sponsorblock, Enhancer for Youtube (Shorts to normal video conversion), and Alternate player for twitch.
## Online Security
The first step to online security is to determine one's threat model.
- **Low-Risk Scenarios**: General marketing and spam emails are an annoyance, but the risk to you is relatively low.
- **Medium-Risk Scenarios**: Personal data breaches might lead to identity theft or unwanted surveillance.
- **High-Risk Scenarios**: Journalists, activists, or people living under repressive regimes may face arrest, harassment, or worse if their activities are exposed.
Your privacy measures should match the risks you face. If you're a casual internet user, securing your accounts and using privacy-respecting tools may be sufficient. However, if your livelihood or safety is at risk, stricter measures like encryption, anonymity, or offline backups may be necessary.
## But I Have Nothing to Hide?
1. **Data Exploitation**: Your personal data is highly valuable to companies and governments. Data can be exploited to manipulate consumer behaviour, influence politics, or target you with predatory advertising. Your data can be used for profit without your consent.
2. **Identity Theft**: Personal information can be gathered through aggregated fingerprinting; compiling the information between multiple websites, which can be used to build a profile used for identity theft. You definitely want your financial, health, political, and social information hidden from bad actors.
3. **Autonomy and Control**: Governments and corporations controlling your online activity can lead to erosion of freedoms and autonomy, or at the very least cost you subscription fees. Having control over your own data allows you to use it as you see fit instead of being at the mercy of whoever else has it.
4. **Future Abuse**: Data that seems harmless today could be used against you as culture and laws change over time. Protecting privacy ensures that past actions or associations won't be misinterpreted or used against you in a shifting political landscape.
Of course this should only be pursued to the extent of psychological comfort; being too paranoid about your online footprint can be detrimental. There is a level of balance between security and convince dependant on one's threat model. There are things that increase both, such as password managers and ad-blockers.
## Viruses and Malware
Accessing sketchy websites or programs can punch a vulnerability into your computer, allowing the attacker to use your hardware and data for their own ends. Both viruses and malware can compromise security, steal data, or degrade system performance, often spreading through phishing, malicious downloads, or vulnerable networks. For the most part the operating system's built in security will do fine. Software such as Malware Bytes or Windows Defender can help clean up attacks. Most often the best course of action when a system is compromised is to backup all the personal data, wipe the drives, and reinstall everything.
## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
Free and Open Source Software is often more difficult to use and lacks support, but allows greater freedoms. The better you are with technology, the more freedom you have with it.
