# Personal Defense in Canada
- Sections 34 and 35 support self-defense and defense of property are not criminally culpable.
- You can prevent someone from entering your property, stealing or damaging your property, and physically remove them from your property.
- You can defend yourself or another if attacked.
- Reasonable force only, lethal force is generally not appropriate.
- Never tell a cop something is for self defense, make up some excuse.
- Knives must be under 10cm (3.9"), no spring/gravity/push/butterfly/switch/belt, not in Quebec, needed for a job and not self-defense.
- Firearms require authorisation to carry and are usually only granted to certain occupations, where police are insufficient, and winning a firearm self-defense case is difficult as there are no protections for using a firearm for self defense.
- To own a firearm one would need to complete a Canadian Firearms Safety Course (CFSC) or CRFSC for restricted firearms (handguns), safety exam, Firearms Possession and Acquisition License (PAL), and Authorisation to Transport Restricted Firearms.
- Canada prohibits pepper spray but a Possession and Acquisition License can allow it.
- Canada prohibits the use of tasers and stun guns.
- Canada prohibits the use of batons and brass knuckles.
- Tactical flashlights, pens, personal alarms are ok
