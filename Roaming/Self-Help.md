## Curiosity
Smart people often believe in stupid things. Identify your personal biases and use curiosity, learning, experimentation, humility, irony, and sarcasm to override, challenge, and verify your beliefs. Use belief as a tool.
## `="[[Journals/"+dateformat(date(now),"yyyy")+"]]"`
Recording personal episodic events and thoughts in order to reflect upon them. Enter the mundane tasks of the day at the start of the day not the end
this will help productivity as opposed to writing boring every day garbage. Write down bullet points of daily events and tasks and categorise tasks. Ask an AI for guided journal prompts. Write something you are grateful for. Dump all the ideas floating around in your mind. Imagine reading your journal down the line.

## Visualisation
## Eyes
Keep your work at or above eye level so you are looking up at it but take care to not strain your neck. Practice focusing your eyes on a single point and do not let them drift, but remember to gently blink consistently to prevent dryness. A candle (real, electric, or even virtual) can help. Periodically shift your focus to the distance for a bit to keep them healthy, an imposition Visualisation of outer space when indoors can help.
## Posture
Sitting up straight improves focus and physical health. Alternate between standing and sitting.
## Breathe
test your carbon tolerance and cycle box breathing. Breath in-2-3-4, hold-2-3-4, out-2-3-4 is a good place to start. 
## Relax
Breath in and clench a part of your body, then breath out and relax it. Continue bottom to top or top to bottom. Periodically focus and soothe any part that tenses. Jaw, neck, and eyes are the hardest but most important. 
## Grounding
Focus on the present. "Reality checks don't bounce." Count your fingers, plug your nose and try to breathe through it, try to put a finger through your hand, and check the clocks. Observe your body and your surroundings carefully. Visualise roots extending downwards from yourself. 
## Nothing
Seriously just do nothing, boredom is healthy. Staring at the sky, ceiling, or wall will help creativity. Being in a non-stimulating environment during this is important. 
## Meditation
Do the above steps in order while cultivating mindfulness. Detach from the daydreams and periodically ground and centre. 
## Mantra
Invent terms or visualisations (thought-forms) you can repeat to yourself repeatedly for internal conditioning. If it feels silly, even being ironic can recondition you. 
## Body Awareness Training
Exercises such as Balance, Stretching, Yoga, Tai-Chi, Qigong, Body Scan Meditation, Walking Backward, and Astral Body practices can develop greater body awareness and control. 
## Self Defense
Tactical Flashlights and Personal Alarms should be legal everywhere and can blind attackers (esp high with dilated pupils) [[Canadian Law]]. Check out videos on fighting styles like Jiu-Jitsu, Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Judo, Wing Chun, MMA, Boxing. Other hobbies like HEMA, Airsoft Gunplay, and combat LARP can help.
