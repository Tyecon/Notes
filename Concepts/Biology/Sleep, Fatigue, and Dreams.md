# Cognitive Fatigue and Frontal Cortex Metabolism[^1]
- **Decision-making drain**: The prefrontal cortex consumes glucose during cognitive tasks like decision-making and problem-solving.
- **Adenosine build-up**: Mental effort triggers the accumulation of adenosine in the brain, which promotes tiredness by reducing neural activity.
- **Glucose depletion**: Sustained focus leads to glucose exhaustion, contributing to feelings of cognitive fatigue. The by-product of glutamates buildup causing decision-making and problem solving to become more difficult as the day goes on.
- **Restoration**: Sleep clears adenosine from synapses, helping restore mental energy.
# Caffeine
- **How caffeine works**: Caffeine is an **adenosine receptor antagonist**; it binds to adenosine receptors without activating them, preventing adenosine from inducing sleepiness.
- **Temporary relief**: While caffeine blocks adenosine, the chemical still accumulates in the background. Fatigue returns once the caffeine wears off.
- **Overuse impact**: Regular caffeine consumption can reduce sensitivity to its effects, leading to a cycle of dependence.
- **Coffee Crash Trick:** A nap will clear up adenosine build up, so timing your caffeine use right after napping will give much more energy. It's better to time the caffeine use as you start working instead of after you wake up. This will also help men with the one hour after waking [[Hormones|testosterone spike]] that can cause anxiety during the commute and start of the day.
# Sleep Hygiene
Sleep hygiene refers to habits and environmental factors that promote consistent, high-quality sleep. These practices help regulate circadian rhythms, improve mental and physical health, and reduce sleep disturbances.
- **Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, strengthens the body's circadian rhythm.
- **Bedtime Routine**: Relaxing and self-care activities and avoiding screen exposure within 1 hour of bedtime.
- **Lighting**: Bright lights with a cool (blue) colour during work hours, warm (red) dim lights before sleep (blue light filters on electronic devices), ideally darkness during sleep. Light, especially cooler colours stimulates the pineal gland which is responsible for regulating [[Hormones|Melatonin]] the sleepiness hormone, and will mess with the body's circadian rhythm. **Blackout Curtains** and **Sleep Masks** help a lot here.
- **Sleep Environment**: A cool room, no noise or white noise (static sound/quiet fans), no little LED lights (electrical tape helps), comfortable mattress and pillows. A **weighted blanket** can be nice when it's cold, just don't get it too heavy.
- **Avoid Stimulants Late in the Day**: Limit [[Sleep, Fatigue, and Dreams#Caffeine|caffeine]], nicotine, and alcohol, as they disrupt sleep cycles. Caffeine, for example, blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleepiness.
- **Daytime Habits**: Sunlight exposure; UV and blue light during the daytime, regular physical activity but not too close to bedtime, careful with napping too much.
## Energy Inventory
A cognitive behavioural trick to deal with fatigue is at the end of the day meditate and replay the day in your head. Pay attention to your emotions, energy levels, symptoms, and what things may have helped or hindered. You can use a spreadsheet, journal, or a symptom tracker app like Bearable to draw up statistical data over time.
## Phones Causing Fatigue
Phones emit blue light, which can disrupt the body's natural circadian rhythms by inhibiting melatonin production. Melatonin is crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. Exposure to blue light before bedtime can make it more challenging to fall asleep and may lead to reduced sleep quality.  
Engaging with phones often involves scrolling through social media, playing games, or consuming content, which can be mentally stimulating. This stimulation may lead to increased arousal and difficulty winding down before sleep, contributing to insomnia and feelings of fatigue the next day​. Constant notifications can add to cognitive fatigue.  
The use of phones, especially late at night, can displace sleep time. The temptation to check messages or engage in late-night activities often results in individuals going to bed later than intended. This results in sleep deprivation, contributing to increased fatigue and impaired cognitive function during the day.
 - Your phone should require pressing the power button to wake.
 - Get a separate alarm clock with it's own power supply/battery.
 - Social Media and Games should be buried on later pages.
 - Notifications and badges should be heavily restricted.
 - Set automatic Do Not Disturb (sometimes called bedtime mode) and Blue Light Filter settings.
## Sleep Cycle Interruption
Waking up at a specific time without considering your sleep cycle can lead to waking during deeper stages of sleep, causing increased fatigue and irritability. Alarm clocks that gradually increase their sound or simulate natural light may provide a gentler waking experience, minimizing this effect. Alarm clocks that produce a loud, abrupt sound can lead to a sudden awakening, which may result in sleep inertia—grogginess and disorientation after waking.
# **Stress And Anxiety**
- Stress triggers the release of [[Hormones|cortisol]], the body's primary stress hormone. Elevated cortisol levels, especially at night, interfere with the natural decrease in alertness that helps initiate sleep. Chronically high cortisol also shortens slow-wave (deep) sleep, reducing sleep quality. Anxiety can cause excessive mental alertness, making it hard to relax.
- Stress reduces the proportion of REM sleep, the phase linked to emotional processing. This disruption can create a feedback loop: inadequate REM sleep heightens emotional reactivity, worsening stress and anxiety the next day.
- Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system (the "fight or flight" response), making it difficult for the parasympathetic system (the "rest and digest" mode) to engage. This imbalance keeps the heart rate elevated, further preventing relaxation necessary for sleep
- People with anxiety disorders or acute stress may experience racing thoughts, which delay sleep onset and increase the risk of waking up frequently during the night. Anxiety about falling asleep or worrying about daily problems can cause sleep onset insomnia. Additionally, stress and anxiety may lead to early morning awakenings, making it hard to complete a full sleep cycle.
# Supplements
Melatonin tablets, Sleep teas, and products like ZzzQuil, which often contain valerian root, chamomile, lavender, mint, lemongrass, and melatonin, may help improve sleep through several mechanisms. [^2]
- **Valerian root** can enhance [[Hormones|GABA]] activity in the brain, promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality, particularly for those with insomnia-related issues.
- **Chamomile** has mild sedative properties due to apigenin, a compound that binds to receptors in the brain to reduce anxiety.
- **Lavender** is known to reduce stress and may contribute to better sleep outcomes when inhaled or consumed in tea form.
- **[[Hormones|Melatonin]]**, often included in these formulations, directly influences the body's sleep-wake cycle by signalling the brain to prepare for sleep.  
While these ingredients offer potential benefits, their effects vary between individuals. Some studies show valerian can improve sleep latency and quality, but others report mixed results. Additionally, the ritual of drinking warm tea as part of a nightly routine can reinforce good sleep hygiene and reduce pre-sleep anxiety, which also contributes to better sleep outcomes.  
These herbal remedies are generally considered safe for short-term use, but individual sensitivities or interactions with medications should be monitored. Long-term use of melatonin, in particular, should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
# Hypnagogia
Hypnagogia is the transitional state of consciousness between wakefulness and sleep. It occurs as one begins to fall asleep and can be characterized by a variety of experiences, including visual and auditory hallucinations, sensations of floating or falling, hearing one's named called, and a sense of disorientation. These sensations can happen while awake if the person is narcoleptic. Since the state often brings greater creativity, many notable figures such as Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Newton, and Carl Jung used hypnagogia on purpose through tricks like holding one's arm up or holding a steel ball above a pan so if they fell asleep it would drop and wake them.
# Dreaming
Dreaming occurs primarily during the **REM (Rapid Eye Movement)** phase of sleep. In this state, brain activity resembles wakefulness, but the body remains paralysed, possibly as a safety mechanism to prevent acting out dreams. Dreams help with emotional processing, memory consolidation, skill enhancement, and problem-solving.
## Lucid Dreaming[^3]
Lucid dreaming happens when the dreamer becomes consciously aware that they are dreaming. In some cases, the dreamer can manipulate the dream environment, characters, or storyline. Research into lucid dreaming shows that it occurs due to a heightened level of prefrontal cortex activation, which is typically suppressed during REM sleep.
- **Reality Checks**: Throughout the day ask yourself "Am I dreaming?" and count your fingers, test your breathing, and check the time. Eventually building this into a habit will cause it to happen during dreams. This is a form of [[Meditation#Grounding|meditative grounding]].
- [[Dream Journal|Dream Journaling]]: Recording personal dreams. This will make you remember more of your dreams and interact with your subconscious.
- **Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD)**: This involves affirming before sleep that you will recognise when you are dreaming.
- **Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB)**: Waking up for a short period during the night, then returning to sleep, increases the chance of entering REM sleep consciously.
## Nightmares
Nightmares are vivid, disturbing dreams that often cause fear, anxiety, or distress. They usually occur during the REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep and can be triggered by stress, trauma, medication, or irregular sleep patterns. While occasional nightmares are normal, frequent ones may indicate underlying psychological or medical issues. Managing nightmares can involve stress reduction techniques, improved sleep hygiene, or therapy if they significantly impact well-being.  
The trick to dealing with nightmares is to imagine Markiplier in a popup in the corner of your vision playing as you and controlling your body.
# Sleep Paralysis
Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon where an individual, upon waking or falling asleep, experiences an inability to move or speak. This condition is often accompanied by hallucinations, which can be auditory or visual. The episodes can last from a few seconds to a couple of minutes and may occur with a sense of pressure on the chest or feelings of dread. Sleep paralysis is often linked to disrupted sleep patterns, such as irregular sleep schedules, sleep deprivation, or conditions like narcolepsy. Stress and anxiety can also exacerbate the frequency and intensity of episodes​. Researchers have suggested that the phenomenon of sleep paralysis may explain some reports of alien abduction experiences. The combination of sensory overload, fear, and the inability to move can create a highly suggestive state, where individuals may unconsciously weave their fears into narratives of night terrors, alien abductions, and demonic encounters.
>[!NOTE] I've always found sleep paralysis to be the loading screen of dreams, and have experienced euphoria during it due to the event being a predictor of getting high quality sleep or lucid dreaming.
# Narcolepsy
This is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks. In addition to excessive daytime sleepiness, symptoms can include cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle control), sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations that can be frightening. Individuals with narcolepsy often experience hypnagogic hallucinations as they transition into sleep or during sudden sleep episodes during the day. These hallucinations can be vivid and may include visual or auditory experiences that blur the line between reality and dreams. Which can lead to problems and personality traits similar to schizotypal [[Mental Wellness#Disorders|personality disorders]].
# Chronotypes[^4]
Sleep chronotypes refer to individual variations in the timing of sleep-wake cycles. These natural preferences for activity during specific times of the day are governed by circadian rhythms. Chronotypes typically fall into three main categories: **morningness (early birds)**, **eveningness (night owls)**, and **intermediates**, though some studies have identified a potential fourth, bimodal type, combining morning and evening tendencies.  
Chronotypes influence more than just sleep schedules—they affect health, mood, and performance. Adolescents tend to shift towards later chronotypes, preferring late bedtimes and waking times, while adults gradually move back towards morningness with age. Gender also plays a role; for example, men generally show later chronotypes before age 40 but reverse that trend after 40.
# ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)
- Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, long-term condition characterized by extreme fatigue not alleviated by rest.
- **Post-exertional malaise (PEM)**: Even minimal physical or cognitive exertion can result in severe exhaustion and worsening symptoms.
- **Brain energy dynamics**: Some studies suggest that ME/CFS patients experience impaired glucose metabolism in the brain, possibly explaining cognitive fatigue.
- **Management**: There is no definitive cure, but energy conservation strategies (e.g., pacing) and symptom management approaches (e.g., sleep hygiene) can help.
- **Spinal Fluid Biomarkers**: Emerging research shows that some cases of ME/CFS and long COVID may be detected by analyzing enzyme levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). [^5] Abnormal enzyme activity, such as inflammatory markers or metabolic dysfunction, has been reported in these conditions. CSF biomarkers could provide objective diagnostic tools for these illnesses, which are currently diagnosed primarily through symptoms.
>[!NOTE] I've experienced the symptoms of CFS since 2009, but only started the diagnosis in 2019. A lot of my the problems I had through my early adulthood can be explained through this.
