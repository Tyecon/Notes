# Diphenhydramine[^1]
Diphenhydramine is an **antihistamine** that blocks the action of histamine, a substance involved in allergic reactions. It is commonly sold under brand names like **Benadryl** and is also included in some sleep aids like **ZZZQuil**. It can be effective for **short-term insomnia** but regular use may reduce its efficacy due to tolerance.
- **Allergic reactions**: Reduces symptoms of hay fever, hives, and insect bites.
- **Sleep aid**: Diphenhydramine has sedative properties and is widely used in over-the-counter sleep aids.
- **Motion sickness**: It helps prevent nausea and dizziness during travel.
- **Cold and flu symptoms**: Included in multi-symptom products to reduce sneezing and runny nose.
## How it Works
Diphenhydramine **crosses the blood-brain barrier** and blocks ACH / H1 histamine receptors in the brain, leading to drowsiness but relief from allergies.
## Risks and Side Effects
- **Drowsiness and Cognitive Impairment**: While helpful at bedtime, residual drowsiness can impair functioning the next day, especially if taken late at night. The drowsiness can last up to 60 hours. Chronic use is associated with **cognitive decline** and may contribute to **dementia** in older adults.
- **Anticholinergic Effects**: Diphenhydramine can cause **dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, and constipation** by blocking acetylcholine receptors.
- **Dependence and Tolerance**: Regular use as a sleep aid may result in **tolerance**, requiring higher doses for the same effect. Some individuals may develop psychological dependence.
- **Paradoxical Reactions**: In some cases, particularly in children, diphenhydramine can cause **agitation or hyperactivity** instead of sedation.
## Dosing
- **Sleep aid**: 25–50 mg before bedtime (adults).
- **Allergies**: 25–50 mg every 4–6 hours as needed, not exceeding **300 mg/day**.
- **Avoid combining with alcohol** or other sedatives to prevent excessive drowsiness or respiratory depression.
- **Not recommended for older adults** due to the risk of cognitive side effects and falls.
- **Use during pregnancy**: Consult with a healthcare provider before use.
## Alternatives
Since diphenhydramine is linked to cognitive decline it is recommend to avoid it unless prescribed or experiencing extreme allergic reactions. [[#Loratadine]] or [[#Fexofenadine]] are much better against allergens, and [[Sleep, Fatigue, and Dreams/#Supplements]]
# Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen is a **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)** commonly used to reduce **pain, fever, and inflammation**. It is available over the counter in products like **Advil** and **Motrin** and is often recommended for conditions like headaches, fevers, muscle pain, menstrual cramps, and arthritis.
## How It Works
Ibuprofen blocks **cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes**, which are responsible for producing **prostaglandins**—chemicals that trigger pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting COX enzymes, ibuprofen reduces these symptoms, making it effective for mild to moderate pain and swelling.
## Risks and Side Effects
- **Gastrointestinal Issues**: It can irritate the stomach lining, leading to **ulcers, heartburn, or gastrointestinal bleeding**.
- **Kidney Problems**: NSAIDs can reduce blood flow to the kidneys, making them risky for people with pre-existing kidney conditions.
- **Heart Risks**: High doses or prolonged use of ibuprofen can increase the risk of **heart attack or stroke**, especially in people with cardiovascular conditions.
- **Drug Interactions**: Ibuprofen can interact with blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), other NSAIDs, or corticosteroids, increasing the risk of bleeding.
## Dosage Guidelines
- **Adults**: 200–400 mg every 4–6 hours as needed, with a maximum of **3200 mg/day** under medical supervision.
- **Children**: Dosing is based on weight, typically **5–10 mg/kg** every 6–8 hours.
# Acetominophine / Paracetamol
Acetaminophen is a widely used over-the-counter medication for **pain relief** (analgesic) and **fever reduction** (antipyretic). It's commonly found in products like **Tylenol** and in multi-symptom cold medicines, such as **DayQuil** and **NyQuil**.
## How it Works
Acetaminophen acts on the brain by reducing the production of **prostaglandins**, chemicals that cause pain and fever. Unlike NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), it does not have anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it better suited for mild to moderate pain rather than swelling-related issues.
## Dosing and Safety
The **recommended dose for adults** is typically **500–1000 mg every 4-6 hours**, not exceeding **4000 mg in 24 hours** to avoid liver damage.
## Risks and Side Effects
- **Liver damage**: High doses or chronic use, especially with alcohol consumption, can lead to acute liver failure. Frequent use with caffeine can increase the **metabolic burden on the liver**, particularly in people consuming large amounts of caffeine or alcohol.
- **Drug interactions**: Combining with alcohol, blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), or other acetaminophen-containing products increases risks.
- Symptoms of **overdose** include nausea, vomiting, sweating, confusion, and in severe cases, liver failure.
## Mixing with Caffeine
Caffeine can enhance the pain-relieving effects of acetaminophen through **vasoconstriction** (narrowing blood vessels) and improving **absorption** of acetaminophen, making it work faster. The combination of **acetaminophen** and **caffeine** is commonly found in over-the-counter medications for **headaches, migraines, or tension-type headaches**.
