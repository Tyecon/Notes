# Evaluating the Frame
To resist manipulation, start by critically evaluating the frame of any message:
- **Expectation:** What are you expected to believe or do?
- **Belief:** What assumptions are being made about you and your behaviour?
- **Perception:** How is reality being shaped (e.g., selective facts, missing context)?
- **Definition:** What truth is being asserted as unchallengeable?
- **Information Suppression:** What information is being avoided or silenced?
# Logical Fallacies in Manipulation
Manipulators often rely on logical fallacies to bypass critical thinking. Common fallacies include:
- **Appeal to Emotion:** Using fear, anger, or hope to bypass logic (e.g., _"If you don’t act now, disaster is inevitable!")._
- **Strawman Argument:** Misrepresenting an argument to make it easier to attack (e.g., _"You’re saying we should do nothing?")._
- **Bandwagon Fallacy:** Claiming something is true because everyone supports it (e.g., _"Most people already agree!")._
- **False Dilemma:** Presenting two extreme options with no alternatives (e.g., _"You’re either with us or against us.")._
- **Ad Hominem:** Attacking the person instead of the argument (e.g., _"They’re unqualified to speak on this.")._
- **Appeal to Authority:** Assuming something is true because an authority said so.
- **Slippery Slope:** Arguing that one action will inevitably lead to an extreme outcome.
- **Hasty Generalisation:** Making broad claims with insufficient evidence.
- **Red Herring:** Distracting with irrelevant information.
- **False Equivalence:** Equating two things that are vastly different.
# The FATE System
### Focus
Manipulators control attention by shaping what you focus on and when. Ask yourself: _"Why is this being shown to me now?"_
- **Timing:** Information may be released strategically to distract or shift attention. 
### Authority
Messages often shift tone or rely on pseudo-intellectualism to seem credible.
- **Check for Multiple Sources:** Cross-reference information to verify facts.
- **Watch for Normalising Extremes:** Manipulators may reframe extreme behaviours as acceptable by altering context.
- **Protection Mechanism:** Authorities may claim they are protecting you, using this as justification for controlling information.
### Tribe
Creating in-groups and out-groups fosters polarisation and compliance.
- **Micro Agreements:** Gaining small yeses builds momentum for larger compliance (e.g., _"You agree this matters, right?")._
- **Compliance Shifts:** Emotional appeals, staged group pressures, and false consensus create the illusion of unity (e.g., _"Most people already agree.")._
- **False Consensus:** Framing a belief as universal, even when it’s not.
### Emotion
Emotional responses are used to suppress critical thinking and create urgency.
- **Scarcity Fear:** Manipulating urgency with statements like, _"Act now, or it’ll be too late!"_
- **Tribal Rejection:** Exploiting fear of being outcast (e.g., _"If you disagree, you’re not one of us.")._
- **Archetypes:** Simplifying narratives into heroes, villains, and saviours to elicit emotional responses.
# The FEAR System
## Focus
How can I bring these things into my focus so I have no way to ignore them?
## Emotion
How can I bring these things into the emotional realm?
## Agitation
How will I disrupt my environment enough that I can't slink back into old habits?
What can I do to disrupt my brain's ability to predict the future?
## Repetition
How can I make sure there is a non-stop exposure to these things?
## Tools to Counter Psy-ops
- **Ask Questions:** Why is this being shown to me now? What context is missing? What alternatives exist?
- **Challenge Absolutes:** Look for assumptions and unchallengeable truths.
- **Cross-Check Facts:** Seek out multiple perspectives and sources.
- **Pause for Reflection:** Don’t let urgency override critical thinking.
