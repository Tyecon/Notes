# Dewey Decimal System (DDC)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification
The Dewey Decimal System is a library classification system created by Melvil Dewey in 1876. It organizes library materials by subject using a numeric system, dividing all knowledge into 10 main classes (000–999). Each class is further divided into more specific topics, represented by decimal numbers. This hierarchical system is primarily used by public and school libraries around the world due to its simplicity and ease of use.
**Quick overview of top level headings**:
- 000 – Computer science, information and general works
- 100 – Philosophy and psychology
- 200 – Religion
- 300 – Social sciences
- 400 – Language
- 500 – Pure science
- 600 – Technology
- 700 – Arts and recreation
- 800 – Literature
- 900 – History and geography
# Library of Congress Classification (LCC)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification
The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) system, developed in the early 20th century, is a system of library organization used by most academic and research libraries in North America. It divides subjects into broad categories represented by single letters, with further refinements indicated by additional letters and numbers. LCC is designed to handle large collections and is more detailed and flexible than DDC, making it ideal for specialized and academic collections.

# Zettelkasten
The zettelkasten ("slip-box") personal knowledge management method was developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the 1950s. The original paper version used small paper slip-cards, the size of the cards keeping the ideas atomic.
## Fleeting Notes
Ideas that come to mind get put down on quick fleeting notes. Some people use a personal notebook, or a simple note app to quickly jot down ideas. These are temporary and the inbox should be cleared periodically.
## Literature Notes
Structured notes on reading materials and media. The back of the card has the metadata for the material, along with links to permanent notes.
## Permanent Notes
Fleeting notes are combined to make permanent notes. The small size of the cards keep the ideas short, and atomic. They are given an ID and linked together to form larger ideas, with a heuristic bottom-up approach to prevent option paralysis on sorting the notes. IDs of other related cards are put on the back of the card.
