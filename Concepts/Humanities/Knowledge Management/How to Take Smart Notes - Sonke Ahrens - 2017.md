In Ahren's book he critiques the modern education systems, citing many psychological studies. He argues that education is too focused on short term results (exams and grades), instead of learning as self-directed long term incremental process over time. Ahrens suggests that writing and thinking are intertwined, and without an external system we run out of cognitive space to function with. He describes Luhmann's zettelkasten system as a perfect example of how to learn over time, engage with ideas, and make connections between various topics. Luhmann's heuristic ID system subverts the problem of linear topic based thinking that educational courses constrain to; allowing a more flexible approach for ideas to evolve.
