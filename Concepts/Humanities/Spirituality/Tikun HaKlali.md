### **Psalm 16** (A Miktam of David)
Protect me, O God, for in You I take refuge.  
I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from You."  
As for the holy ones who are in the land, they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.  
Those who choose other gods multiply their sorrows;  
I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, nor take up their names on my lips.  
The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; You hold my lot.  
The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a goodly inheritance.  
I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.  
I keep the LORD always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.  
Therefore, my heart is glad, and my soul rejoices; my body also dwells secure.  
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor let Your faithful one see corruption.  
You show me the path of life; in Your presence there is fullness of joy;  
At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
### **Psalm 32** (Of David, A Maskil)
Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.  
Blessed is the one to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.  
When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.  
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as in the heat of summer.  
Then I acknowledged my sin to You, and I did not hide my iniquity.  
I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and You forgave the guilt of my sin.  
Therefore, let all the faithful pray to You while You may be found;  
Surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach them.  
You are my hiding place; You preserve me from trouble; You surround me with shouts of deliverance.  
I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you.  
Do not be like the horse or the mule, without understanding,  
whose temper must be curbed with bit and bridle, else it will not stay near you.  
Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds those who trust in the LORD.  
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
### **Psalm 41**
Blessed is the one who considers the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.  
The LORD will protect him and keep him alive; he will be called blessed in the land.  
You will not give him over to the will of his enemies.  
The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness, You restore him to health.  
As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You."  
My enemies speak evil of me: "When will he die, and his name perish?"  
And if one comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it.  
All who hate me whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me:  
"A deadly thing has fastened upon him; he will not rise again from where he lies."  
Even my close friend, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.  
But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.  
By this I know that You delight in me: my enemy does not triumph over me.  
As for me, You uphold me in my integrity and set me before Your face forever.  
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
### **Psalm 42**
As the deer longs for the water brooks, so my soul longs for You, O God.  
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?  
My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"  
These things I remember as I pour out my soul:  
How I went with the throng and led them in procession to the house of God,  
with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.  
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me?  
Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, my salvation and my God.  
My soul is cast down within me; therefore, I remember You from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.  
Deep calls to deep at the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and breakers have swept over me.  
By day the LORD commands His steadfast love, and at night His song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.  
I say to God, my rock: "Why have You forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"  
As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"  
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me?  
Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, my salvation and my God.
### **Psalm 59**
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.  
Deliver me from evildoers; save me from bloodthirsty men.  
For behold, they lie in wait for my life; mighty men assemble against me, not for my transgression nor my sin, O LORD.  
Without guilt of mine, they run and prepare themselves.  
Awake to help me, and behold!  
You, O LORD God of hosts, are the God of Israel.  
Rise up to punish all the nations; do not be merciful to wicked traitors.  
Each evening they return, howling like dogs and prowling the city.  
They spew forth with their mouths; swords are on their lips: "Who hears us?"  
But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You hold all the nations in derision.  
O my Strength, I will watch for You, for You, O God, are my fortress.  
My God will go before me with His steadfast love; He will let me see my enemies' downfall.  
Do not slay them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and bring them down.  
For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride.  
For the curses and lies they utter, consume them in wrath; let them be no more.  
Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob.  
Each evening they return, howling like dogs and prowling the city.  
They wander about for food and growl if they are not satisfied.  
But I will sing of Your strength; I will sing aloud of Your steadfast love in the morning.  
For You have been my fortress, my refuge in the day of trouble.  
To You, O my Strength, I will sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my merciful God.
### **Psalm 77** (A Psalm of Asaph)
I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and He will hear me.  
In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;  
my soul refuses to be comforted.  
When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah  
You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.  
I consider the days of old, the years long ago.  
I said, "Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart."  
Then my spirit made a diligent search:  
"Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favourable?  
Has His steadfast love forever ceased?  
Are His promises at an end for all time?  
Has God forgotten to be gracious?  
Has He in anger shut up His compassion?" Selah  
Then I said, "I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High."  
I will remember the deeds of the LORD;  
yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.  
I will ponder all Your work, and meditate on Your mighty deeds.  
Your way, O God, is holy.  
What god is great like our God?  
You are the God who works wonders;  
You have made known Your might among the peoples.  
You with Your arm redeemed Your people,  
the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah  
When the waters saw You, O God, when the waters saw You, they were afraid;  
indeed, the deep trembled.  
The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder;  
your arrows flashed on every side.  
The crash of Your thunder was in the whirlwind;  
Your lightnings lighted up the world;  
the earth trembled and shook.  
Your way was through the sea,  
Your path through the great waters; yet Your footprints were unseen.  
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
### **Psalm 90** (A Prayer of Moses, the man of God)
Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.  
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world,  
from everlasting to everlasting You are God.  
You return man to dust and say, "Return, O children of man!"  
For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is past,  
or as a watch in the night.  
You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream,  
like grass that is renewed in the morning:  
in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.  
For we are brought to an end by Your anger; by Your wrath we are dismayed.  
You have set our iniquities before You,  
our secret sins in the light of Your presence.  
For all our days pass away under Your wrath;  
we bring our years to an end like a sigh.  
The years of our life are seventy,  
or even by reason of strength eighty;  
yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
they are soon gone, and we fly away.  
Who considers the power of Your anger,  
and Your wrath according to the fear of You?  
So teach us to number our days  
that we may get a heart of wisdom.  
Return, O LORD! How long?  
Have pity on Your servants!  
Satisfy us in the morning with Your steadfast love,  
that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.  
Make us glad for as many days as You have afflicted us,  
and for as many years as we have seen evil.  
Let Your work be shown to Your servants,  
and Your glorious power to their children.  
Let the favour of the Lord our God be upon us,  
and establish the work of our hands upon us;  
yes, establish the work of our hands.
### **Psalm 150** (Let everything that has breath praise the LORD)
Praise the LORD!  
Praise God in His sanctuary;  
praise Him in His mighty heavens!  
Praise Him for His mighty deeds;  
praise Him according to His excellent greatness!  
Praise Him with trumpet sound;  
praise Him with lute and harp!  
Praise Him with tambourine and dance;  
praise Him with strings and pipe!  
Praise Him with sounding cymbals;  
praise Him with loud clashing cymbals!  
Let everything that has breath praise the LORD!  
Praise the LORD!
