## Visualisation
Focus on a point. Refocusing.
## Mindfulness
## Eyes
Keep your work at or above eye level so you are looking up at it but take care to not strain your neck. Practice focusing your eyes on a single point and do not let them drift, but remember to gently blink consistently to prevent dryness. A candle (real, electric, or even virtual) can help. Periodically shift your focus to the distance for a bit to keep them healthy, an imposition Visualisation of outer space when indoors can help.
## Posture
Sitting up straight improves focus and physical health. Alternate between standing and sitting.
## Breathe
test your carbon tolerance and cycle box breathing. Breath in-2-3-4, hold-2-3-4, out-2-3-4 is a good place to start.
## Relax
Breath in and clench a part of your body, then breath out and relax it. Continue bottom to top or top to bottom. Periodically focus and soothe any part that tenses. Jaw, neck, and eyes are the hardest but most important.
## Grounding
Focus on the present. "Reality checks don't bounce." Count your fingers, plug your nose and try to breathe through it, try to put a finger through your hand, and check the clocks. Observe your body and your surroundings carefully. Visualise roots extending downwards from yourself.
## Nothing
Seriously just do nothing, boredom is healthy. Staring at the sky, ceiling, or wall will help creativity. Being in a non-stimulating environment during this is important.
## Meditation
Do the above steps in order while cultivating mindfulness. Detach from the daydreams and periodically ground and centre.
## Mantra
Invent terms or visualisations (thought-forms) you can repeat to yourself repeatedly for internal conditioning. If it feels silly, even being ironic can recondition you.
## Body Awareness Training
Exercises such as Balance, Stretching, Yoga, Tai-Chi, Qigong, Body Scan Meditation, Walking Backward, and Astral Body practices can develop greater body awareness and control.
