## Charisma & Seduction
Identify your core, immutable personality traits. Then develop a vision of the person you aspire to be on top of these. Refrain from crafting fictional narratives about yourself, as they can be detrimental and lead to internal discord, regardless of whether they're exposed or kept hidden.[^1] It's essential to maintain honesty both with yourself and those around you. Then, commit to the necessary steps and practice to embody that ideal persona. When you aim to exude confidence and charm, tap into your inner sense of irony and adopt the demeanour of your envisioned character. [^2]
## Loneliness & Community
Learn to enjoy your own company, as well as the company of others. Being alone is better than being around awful people. If your company is awful you will still feel alone or worse go against your own morals to people please. If you are awful to yourself you will feel more alone than ever. If you are kind to yourself and enjoy your own company loneliness becomes peaceful solitude. If you hate humanity in general you will be afraid to be around humanity. While vigilance and personal power is important, always start with kindness (but not excessive compassion) until they prove undeserving. If you are kind to others and they reflect that, their company becomes a sense of community. It's all about the mood you are in.
