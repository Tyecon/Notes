** Philosophical System
Kant primarily articulates his philosophical system in his major works, including the "Critique of Pure Reason," the "Critique of Practical Reason," and the "Critique of Judgment." These works hold a significant place among the most important philosophical treatises ever written.
** Epistemology
Kant explores the nature and limits of human knowledge in his "Critique of Pure Reason." He argues that the mind's innate structures shape the extent of human knowledge, and casuality such as space and time shape our experience of the world.
** Ethics
In the "Critique of Practical Reason," Kant develops his ethical theory, known as deontological ethics. According to Kant, rationality and categorical imperative form the basis of moral principles, which dictate that one should act in accordance with principles that can be universally applied without contradiction.
** Aesthetics
Kant's "Critique of Judgment" explores the nature of aesthetic judgment and the experience of beauty. He argues subjective feelings of pleasure along with a sense of univerality and disinterestedness form judgements of beauty.
** Political Philosophy
Kant emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, moral autonomy, and the rule of law in his political philosophy. He advocates for a [[id:671dec94-4173-4f8b-8fa4-9eebd0004767][republican]] form of government based on principles of justice and respect for human dignity.
** Influence
Kant's ideas profoundly influence subsequent philosophy, shaping debates in areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political theory. Philosophers around the world continue to study and debate his work.

* The One Rule for Life - After Skool with Mark Manson
[cite:@afterskoolONERULELIFE2024]
- What we care about, and what we don't care about. For something to be good it has to be universal in every situation.
- "Act the way you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means." Ends are our goals, means are the way we get to them. Treating any living being (especially the sapient) as a means to an end is unethical, as an end ethical.
- Rationality and consciouness are the purpose of the universe. The protection & promotion of rational consciousness in each individual is the basis of morality.
- We have a moral imperative to do the best we can at all times. Using substances and activities to ignore our problems is using ourselves as a mean to an end of escaping our problems. Kant advocates to meet our problems head on.
- Manipulating someone for gain is unethical. He advocated for mutual consent and respect for the other's response.
- People pleasing is manipulating yourself and them as a means of making someone like you, instead of accepting your own opinions.
- Advertising is using people as a means to financial gain, therefore unethical. Anyone who amasses a fortune likily got it through constant manipulation.
- Racism, colonialism, and slavery is directly using people as a means to an end. He supported large inter-country governing bodies.
- It is impossible to know whether a person deserves to be happy or suffer because you can never know their intentions and aims. Even if you should make others happy, there's no way to know how to. What constitues suffering or happiness is often unclear. They only way to improve the world is to improve ourselves, because it is the only thing we can experience.
- There is a fundamental link between respect for ourselves and the respect for others. Self respect is about knowing your own value. Self love is a person's duty. At the age of 40 he redesigned his life, and took on a strict routine. He believes most people cannot develop character until half way in their lives because they are still seduced by the fancies of the world. He belived that the purpose of people is to master themselves, regardless of whether it is possible in a lifetime.
- "Rules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for."
