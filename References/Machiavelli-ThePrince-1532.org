* How Good People Lose Power - Unsolicited Advice
[cite:@unsolicitedadviceHowGoodPeople2024]

- It is much better to hold a pessimistic view on people and be pleasantly surprised than naively optimistic.

- If you neglect to do the necessary work to maintain power, someone worse than you will simply replace you.

- You need power to get anything done. This is later supported in Nietzscheâ€™s [[id:c8d8f210-b3de-4b5f-a969-43f9335e10ef][Beyond Good and Evil]].

- All alliances will fall apart without personal power. Mercenaries and allies will flee as things fall apart, but people fighting for their homes will often fight to the death.

- People push gratitude aside the minute it becomes inconvenient. Fear of punishment keeps people in line when times are tough. The cruelest thing to do is show excessive compassion without thought for the consequences.

- Times of peace are times to fortify our spirits and prepare for the oncoming hardships. Supported by [[id:fec99650-1972-4ca3-94cb-552f5c2665d7][Schopenhauer]].

- A leader must adapt to their environment. This includes ignoring or modifying his advice to fit the modern place and time.
